#🎉 Birth Analysis Project

# 📌 Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of daily U.S. births using Python. The goal is to analyze birth trends by day, month, and year to uncover patterns and insights using data visualization and statistical summaries.


# 📂 Features

* Load and preprocess the birth dataset.
* Group and analyze birth counts by year, month, day.
* Visualize trends using line plots, heatmaps, and distributions.
* Detect outliers and identify peak birth periods.



# 🧰 Technologies Used

* Pandas – for data cleaning, grouping, and manipulation.
* NumPy – for numerical operations and handling NaNs.
* Matplotlib – for creating line and scatter plots.
* Seaborn – for heatmaps and distribution visualizations.
